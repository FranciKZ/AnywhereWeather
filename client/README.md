Kinda messy react app, only real purpose for it is to send requests to the GO server so I didn't spend too much time thinking through component hierarchy and/or design of the UI

Any google maps api key that is found in here is locked down and will likely be deleted before anyone tries to use it. Not a fan of committing it but if I were to ever deploy this app it'd be public information anyways from everything I've read so nbd (I think?).
